 * Finding Friends or Number of Islands
 * 
 * This question is asked by Facebook. You are given a two dimensional matrix,friends, that represents relationships 
 * between coworkers in an office. If friends[i][j] = 1 then coworker i is friends with coworker j and coworker j is 
 * friends with coworker i. Similarly if friends[i][j] = 0 then coworker i is not friends with coworker j and coworker 
 * j is not friend with coworker i. Friendships in the office are transitive (i.e. if coworker one is friends with coworker 
 * two and coworker two is friends with coworker three, coworker one is also friends with coworker three). 
 * Given the friendships in the office defined by friends, return the total number of distinct friends groups in the office.
 * 
 * Note: Each coworker is friends with themselves (i.e.matrix[i][j] = 1 for all values where i = j)
 *
 * Ex: Given the following matrix friendsâ€¦
 * 
 * friends = [
 *   [1, 1, 0],
 *   [1, 1, 0],
 *   [0, 0, 1]
 * ], return 2.
 * The 0th and 1st coworkers are friends with one another (first friend group).
 * The 2nd coworker is friends with themself (second friend group).
